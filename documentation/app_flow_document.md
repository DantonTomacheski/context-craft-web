# ContextCraft App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

The journey begins when a new user lands on the ContextCraft website. They are welcomed by a clean, modern landing page that explains the platform's purpose of automating software project documentation through AI using the Context Boundary Method. The user is invited to sign up using either their email and password or through social login options provided by Clerk Auth. After registration, the user receives options to set up or optionally enable multi-factor authentication before they proceed. Those who need help have access to a password recovery feature where they simply enter their email, receive a secure reset link, and follow the instructions. First time users are greeted with an interactive, guided tour that explains key interface elements and the step-by-step process for creating a project. The flow is intuitive and encourages users to explore a demo project produced as a sample of how the documentation is generated.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user is directed to the responsive dashboard, designed primarily for desktop use but fully adaptable on mobile devices. This main view features real‑time metrics like minutes saved and tokens saved at a glance. A fixed sidebar is visible on the far left providing access to the starter kits and a menu for global options such as theme toggling and logout. Nearby, a floating action panel with icon buttons allows for interactions such as initiating code execution or document upload. The central area displays recent projects and other important information, making it obvious how to start a new project or access existing ones. The navigation is seamless, offering breadcrumb trails and a header that helps users know exactly where they are and how to move to other pages in the application.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user decides to create a new project, they are guided into a multi‑step wizard that walks them through the entire process. The first step, called Project Details, displays a header with the app logo, status tags like “Draft”, and basic metadata such as the creation date along with an option to view a detailed description of the project. On the left side of the page, a fixed sidebar lists a variety of starter kits – each represented by scrollable card components – that provide inspiration and quick start options. In the center column, the interface asks, in a large clear heading, “What do you want to build?” and provides helper chips to remind users of purpose, audience, and key features. The user enters a comprehensive description in a spacious text area with additional icon buttons for voice input and refinement. Once the information is complete, an ever-visible sticky “Next Step” button allows users to proceed to the next phase.

For Step 2, the Select AI Tools page presents a tabbed grid of selectable cards that represent the different AI models available (such as GPT-4, GPT o3-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro). A global counter helps track the number of tools chosen, and it is clear how each choice impacts the documentation output. Step 3 immediately follows, where the Complete Questionnaire page is structured with accordion sections and a progress bar. Users can answer detailed questions about their project using either manual input or by allowing the AI to suggest answers that they can skip if desired. Finally, in Step 4 the Create Docs page is where the magic happens. When the user clicks the generate button, an asynchronous call is made via an Edge Function to produce all six documentation types. The screen shows a progress indicator and once completed, presents the output in markdown accordion panels. Each document can be viewed in its entirety and users are given the option to download the full set as a ZIP file. Additionally, every generation event is automatically versioned so that users can view and restore past iterations if needed. Throughout these transitions, page elements such as headers, sidebars, and floating actions remain consistent, ensuring users do not lose context while moving from one page to another.

## Settings and Account Management

At any point during the use of ContextCraft, users can access account management features from the global sidebar or header. Here they can update personal details, configure notification preferences, and adjust security settings such as enabling or managing multi-factor authentication. For billing or subscription management, users are led through a secure settings page where they can review usage, update payment details, and observe any credits or usage limitations. A clear back navigation option is always provided, allowing users to return effortlessly to their projects or the main dashboard once they have made or reviewed changes. This part of the flow is designed to be simple and accessible, ensuring that every update to user preferences is reflected immediately without disrupting the overall experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is built to handle errors gracefully at every step. If a user enters invalid data during project creation or the wizard steps, clear inline messages promptly explain the issue, and subtle visual cues help correct the errors before proceeding. In cases where connectivity is lost or there is an error communicating with an external API for document generation, the system presents a friendly error message on the affected page along with an option to retry the failed action. If a user attempts to access a page or perform an action that is restricted by their role (for example, a Guest trying to generate documentation), a dedicated fallback page informs them that their access is read-only or that they need to sign up to proceed further. The flow is designed to always guide the user back to a safe or corrective state, ensuring that any deviation from the expected path is met with clear instructions on how to return to a normal operation.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new user arrives at ContextCraft, the experience is designed to be clear, engaging, and secure. Beginning with an intuitive onboarding process that includes guided tours and multiple sign-up options, users quickly understand how to manage their profile and start a new project. The main dashboard places important metrics and recent projects front and center, while every crucial task—from entering project details, selecting AI tools, answering in-depth questionnaires, to generating downloadable documentation—is woven into a well-defined multi‑step wizard. Users always know where they are thanks to consistent headers, sidebars, and navigation cues. Settings and account management allow updates without loss of context, and comprehensive error handling strategies ensure that any interruptions are managed smoothly. Ultimately, ContextCraft delivers on its mission by providing a robust, end-to-end journey that automates documentation creation, safeguards version history, and makes every step clear and accessible for developers, product managers, or anyone involved in creating software project documentation.
